paranthesis () 
can be written in single quotes
html is directly connected to browser
variables are containers for data
data is stored in memory loacations
variable name is memory location name and variable value we store in memroy location
null means zero or empty
JS is dynamically typed language 
= is called assignment operator
use camel case for variable name 
var:variable can be re-declared and re-assigned
let:variable cannot be re-delared but can be re-assigned
const:neither re-declared nor re-assigned
we use let and const for declaring variable
if we declare variable with let and does'nt assign value then it give us undefined 
if we declare variable with const and does'nt assign value then it give us error
data types:
7 primitve datatypes
Number,String,Boolean,BigInt,Symbol,Null,Undefined
Non primitive datatypes
Objects(Collection of values)
syntax key:value
ways to check a key exist in object or not
in (check own property also check inherted property)
has own property (only check own property)
				
				OPERATORS,CONDTIONAL STATEMENTS


If we want to print two things in console we use comma ","
unary operator
a++ (post increment)
++a (pre increment)
a-- (post decrement)
--a (pre decrement)
logical return a boolean value (true or false)


					LOOPS AND STRINGS


Loop is to execute a piece of code again & again
initialize,stopping condition,updation or increment/decrement
while loop (increment in the block)
do-while (will run atleast one time if the condition is false)(condition is checked at the end also increment in the block)
for-of loop (used for strings and arrays)(the content inside the braces is called iterator)
for-in loop (used for objects and arrays) 
string literals are represented by backtick(``) in which we embed expression this phenomenon is called string interpolation "${expression}"
escape characters
\n new line
\t tab space  
String Methods(strings are immutable means does'nt change) (original string pr koi effect ni hota 1 new value return krta h)
toUpperCase()
toLowerCase()
trim() (Remove white spaces from start and end of the string)
slice() (returns some part of string which we want)
replace()
concat()
charAt()
indexOf()
